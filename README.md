# Retail-Store-EDA
With the data for a retail store's sales, I was given a task to clean the data and make it applicable for analysis. In this file, I used python to clean the data and preprocessed it. The data had null values and duplicates and also there were many issues with the dtypes of the columns and the entries in it. This was a part of my portfolio project whioe I was on my learning journey. The data can be provided on special requests.
